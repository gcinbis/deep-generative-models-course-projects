Qualitative Goals: Visual comparison of the output image to the input images 
(both the reference image and the target pose). Figure 4 in the paper shows 
the qualitative comparison of the paper to the related work.

Quantitative Goals: FID + PSNR score comparison will be done, just as in the 
Table 1 of the paper.
