METU CENG 796 - Deep Generative Models - Paper re-implementation projects 
=========================================================================

Paper re-implementation projects from the course METU CENG796 Deep Generative Models (Spring 2020, Spring 2021 and Spring 2022).

Each project involves re-implementation of a recent paper, typically from a top-tier machine
learning / computer vision conference, by a student pair. An initial version of each
project is peer-reviewed by project groups. The goal has been to re-produce each paper based on
paper itself, ideally without consulting to existing public implementations of papers, if available.
More information regarding the development process can be found on the course homepages:

The Jupyter notebooks with pre-computed outputs, source codes, obtained results with discussions on
the difficulties encountered during the projects can be found in the project folders listed below.
Please note that some of the pre-computed outputs (animated plots, etc.) may not appear correctly in
github's notebook rendering.

In this repository, the projects are shared as is, with no guarantees, upon kind permissions of the
students. Nearly all projects are licensed with the standard MIT license. Please check the project folders for more
information, including information on project groups.
