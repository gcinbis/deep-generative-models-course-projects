OUR AIM OF THE PROJECT AND EXPECTED RESULTS 

	*In Figure 2 at paper.(It represents any images with prediction below threshold and then generate 
		improved version of this image and their certainty score also it includes their old and new label that is generated by Classifier Module)

	*In Table 1 at paper.(Three row of the table that is reproducing the results for threshold values: 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9)


* We didn't make a change about expected results. However we didn't succeed to take exact results from the paper because of the missing informations and poorly explained methods.

* We increased the accuracy score of the system by applying GWIN framework and Classifier rejection feature. After our process newly generated
	images give higher prediction score and increased the number of true labels but our classifier could not achieve to produce same result with the paper. 
	Since the paper's classifier's number of rejections is higher than our implemented one as a result of this paper is producing bigger accuracy values than ours.
	GWIN framework works on a smaller set because of this difference. But we take good re-produce results from GAN. It increases all the accuracy
	scores for all threshold values. Also our GAN results looks like old one but it gives more prediction scores and true labels because our system learn 
	how classifier understands labels.

* We cannot reproduce exact results of the Table 1 because of the classifier's different accuracy scores(as mentioned above). In paper classifier section is not
	clear. So we had many assumptions on it. And our classifier gives higher certainty scores than paper's classifier. It means that we rejected smaller
	part of the data. And our classifiers accuracy on rejected images is lower than paper's one. But increase ration of the accuracy is nearly same with the paper.
	We think if we could implemented a similar classifier with the paper then we could have more similar results with the paper. But we didn't use our effort on this since the GAN implementation was the most important part for this project.

* We didn't make any change about our goals.
* We reproduced the paper's results actually. But we didn't get exact qualitative result and we mentioned why this could happen at the version 1 submission(above section) and at the 'Challenges Encountered When Implementing Paper' section.
