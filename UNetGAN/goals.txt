Group 2 was assigned the paper "A U-Net Based Discriminator for Generative Adversarial Networks" (link to pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12655.pdf)
We plan to reproduce the quantitative results (primarily the FID score, possibly IS) at Section 4.2, Table 3.
For qualitative results, we plan to show image samples trained on CelebA, the dataset we use for comparing qualitative results.
(The paper does not show examples from this dataset, but we will imitate the shown examples in Figure 5 with the same resolution.)

—— version 1 submission ——
We have implemented most of the contributions of the paper, so there are no change in planned goals. 
As a "checklist":

[x] U-Net GAN Loss
[x] CutMix training
[x] Consistancy loss 
[x] FID calculation
[x] Proposed model design
[ ] Comparative results to Section 4.2, Table 3
[ ] Comparative qualitive results to Figure 5

Even though there are some difficulties with
training (see main.ipynb -> Challenges), we are still aiming to follow the
previous goals.

-- version 2 submission --
We believe that we have implemented all of the contributions mentioned in the paper.
We report qualitative and quantitative results in `main.ipynb`, and talk about the difference in FID (2.95 vs 20) in the 
Challenges Encountered section.
