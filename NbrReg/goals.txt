Deep Semantic Text Hashing with Weak Supervision

We aim to implement the proposed method, namely the NbrReg for the
smallest dataset presented in the paper; 20NewsGroups. We think that
it should be possible to use the method for all bit lengths (8 to
128). It would be nice to implement NbrReg + Doc method but it
requires an additional network to be trained and the results are not
satisfying for the larger datasets. Therefore, we plan to stick to the
core of the paper which is the NbrReg method and plan to use it on
20NewsGroups dataset.

—— version 1 submission ——

* We wanted to obtain results for all bit lengths (8 to 128) but due
  to time limitations only report results for 32 bit

* We obtain 0.36 average precision, whereas authors report 0.46.

* We think that the precision think that this might be due to a simple
  training mistake and we should be able to catch up for 2nd
  revision. For details see the Jupyter notebook submitted.

—— version 2 submission ——

* No changes were needed to be made to our goals

* We've reproduced the results on the data set provided by the paper
  authors almost exactly. But with the data set that we've created the
  results are not comparable to the what's reported in the paper.
