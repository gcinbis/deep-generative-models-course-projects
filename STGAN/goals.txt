Qualitative:Figure 1
Quantitative:We aim to reproduce Attribute generation accuracy metric of Figure 7.

—— version 1 submission ——

Training the model on CelebA dataset took much more than expected.
Details are explained on the notebook

—— version 2 submission ——

Unfortunately, we couldn't achieve our goals.
