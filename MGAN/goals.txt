title: MGAN: Training Generative Adversarial Nets with Multiple Generators

-----------
DECLERATION OF EXPERIMENT RESULTS

We will spesifically work on CIFAR-10 dataset because of the processing power.

We will try to get following results:
1- Figure 2 MGAN performance on Synthetic Data.
2- Table 1 CIFAR-10 MGAN result. (Inception result of MGAN on CIFAR-10 dataset)
3- Figure 3 (a) CIFAR-10 MGAN visual results, or we may take Figure 5 MGAN results on CIFAR-10 at different epoch number. Figure 9 is also presents comperable results but the problem with visual results is that the input vector is not known and they claim these results are cherry-picked, so we may not find exactly similar results but we will try to find comperable with these results.


—— version 1 submission ——
- We have fully working implementation. There are CIFAR10 and synthetic data visual results.
- We have an embedded code that automatically downloads the pre-trained models if they don't exist.
- We have save, load utils functions that help the code runner to continue training.
- Since google collab removes data that stored on session, we implement google drive mounting. Thanks to the google drive mounting, the trained models automatically saved on google drive. If you want to use local storage, you can skip mounting part.
- We have almost the same results with the following figures:
	* Figure 2: The comparison of our MGAN and GAN’s variants on 2D synthetic dataset. (Only MGAN results)
	* Figure 6: Samples generated by MGAN models trained on synthetic data with 2, 3, 4 and 10 generators. Data samples from the 8 Gaussians are in red, and generated data by each generator are in a different color.
	* Figure 7: Samples generated by MGAN models trained on synthetic data with different values of diversity coefficient β. Generated data are in blue and data samples from the 8 Gaussians are in red.
	* Figure 9: Images generated by MGAN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset
	* Figure 5: Images generated by our MGAN trained on CIFAR10 at different epochs. Samples in each row from the top to the bottom correspond to a different generator

Ommitted Part:
- We do not have Table 1 CIFAR-10 MGAN result. (Inception result of MGAN on CIFAR-10 dataset). 
We ommit that from our goals, we already got exactly similar visual results with paper.

Need to debug:
- We need to debug our KL-divergence distance calculation. We may have made a mistake.

—— version 2 submission ——

We have reproduced the goals defined in version 1 and propsals.
